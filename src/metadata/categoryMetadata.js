I’ll briefly talk through the general points presented in the document, but for more detail, check it out. Basically, the first week we don’t want to try to introduce them at all. Transitions are stressful for dogs, so giving [name] a little time to settle in and adjust to [his/her] new environment before introducing them would allow [him/her] to be a little calmer, which can be helpful. During this time, you could also start working on some basic obedience (specifically \"sit\") which will be helpful in this process. Once [name] has settled in, you can do the first real stage of the introductions. You’ll have your dog on leash, and have the cat in the room, preferably contained in a large dog crate or something along those lines, so they can’t get too close to the dog if they want to. While they’re \"interacting\" like this (in the same room, but not close to each other or actually touching), work on rewarding [name] for ignoring the cat and paying attention to you. We basically want to desensitize [him/her] to their presence, so the cat isn’t exciting or something to be worked up about. Continue these exercises of them just existing in the same space, slowly decreasing the space between the two, and look for [name] consistently ignoring or showing calm behavior around the cat. After a week or two of this, move to the next stage, which is letting the cats roam free while [name] is still on leash. Continue to look for appropriate behaviors, and work on letting them get closer. Eventually you’ll transition to letting go of the leash. Keep the leash on [name], but let it drag on the ground. If [he/she] tries to chase the cat, you can step on the leash and halt [him/her] from running. Always supervise them together, and make sure that the cat has lots of \"escape routes\" that the dog cannot follow - baby gates between rooms, cat trees, counters etc. If the cat tries to communicate to [name] to back off (hissing, swatting, etc), make sure [he/she] listens to the cat. If [he/she] continues to try to play/pester the cat when the cat is telling [him/her] to back off, you should step in and back your cat up. Again, check out the document for more detail, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or want to talk through this in more detail.\n",

To reach [him/her] you can step on the leash to stop [him/her] in [his/her] tracks or you can grab the leash to pull [name] away. If [name] approaches the cat to play or appears that [he/she] is going to try to chase, and the cat shows that [he/she] is not interested, try to get [name] over to you by calling [him/her] name calmly and cheerfully, slapping your leg, waving a toy, anything to redirect [his/her] attention.

Once [name] comes over to you, make sure you have something for [him/her] to do, like a puzzle toy or an activity.  It’s important to remember that [name] is probably trying to solicit play from or chase the cat because [he/she] has extra energy and sees the cat as an outlet for that energy. Once we redirect [name], it will be extremely beneficial to help [him/her] expend that energy in an appropriate way. Depending on how busy you are in the moment, this could be a great opportunity to practice some commands or play an indoor game. I have added a document that goes over various games and exercises you can do with [name] to help [him/her] burn that energy in a productive and appropriate way. The document will also go over some options for puzzle toys, which are a great alternative if you need to entertain [name] but can’t actively engage with [him/her] in that moment. Puzzle toys are interactive for dogs and typically require your dog to figure out how to get a treat or kibble out of the toy. Because of the motivation to get the treats inside, puzzle toys can keep your dog self-entertained for longer than regular toys while using up some mental energy.\n",

To start, it’s important to set [name] up for success as best you can. This means removing items from [his/her] reach that [he/she] might try to chew. If [he/she] only has good choices to choose from, [he/she] will get in the habit of picking the right objects. Along with that, you should make sure [he/she] has plenty of other appropriate things to chew on, like toys and bones, so [he/she] can get that chewing urge out in a healthy way. When [he/she] chooses to chew on those, praise [him/her], play with [him/her], do whatever makes [him/her] happy. This will teach [him/her] that chewing on appropriate things results in praise and fun. Another helpful thing will be to teach \"drop\" or \"leave it,\" so when [he/she] gets something that is inappropriate, you can ask for it back without it turning into a game of chase or tug of war. Also, make sure only to correct [him/her] (using verbal corrections like \"no\" or \"eh eh\") while [he/she]’s in the act of chewing something, not afterwards. Getting the timing of the correction down is important, so [he/she] understands that what [he/she]  is doing in that moment is not appropriate. Dogs won’t understand why they are getting scolded if you don’t catch them in the act. They may still act sheepish, but they really don’t connect the dots that the punishment is due to something that happened earlier in the day, so the behavior won't change. For more tips and details, I'm attaching our go-to document on chewing, which has some additional techniques to try to curb this behavior. Depending on how destructive [his/her] chewing is (i.e. ruining entire couches or just lightly munching a shoe) some of the tips may be overkill. Nonetheless, it’s a good resource to start with.

We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. Toss treats in the crate when your pup isn’t around, so next time [he/she] checks out the crate, treats have magically appeared. Ideally, you’d have the time to slowly acclimate [name] to the crate over days or weeks before having to put [him/her] in there for a longer period of time. However, that is usually not feasible, but there are still steps you can take to ensure that you are doing all you can to avoid regressing on training when you have to crate [him/her].

Check out these documents and see if there are any techniques in there that you can use.

If you're not already, feed [him/her] in his crate, and make feeding a bit more of a game for [him/her]. Check out the \"Canine Enrichment\" document I'm attaching for some easy ways to make [him/her] work a little harder on [his/her] food while [he/she] is in the crate. This is beneficial because it channels [his/her] focus into doing something healthy and productive, as opposed to focusing on the fact that [he/she] is stuck in the crate. Also, I would recommend securing the joints of the crate with zip ties. Sometimes dogs bend the metal of the crate enough to be able to escape; using zip ties will make this very difficult to do. If the crate is not showing signs of bending like that, [he/she] may have just figured out how to undo the latch from the inside (if so [he/she] is a smart cookie!). Check out the tutorial on how to \"spy\" on [him/her] via Skype. If you can set that up, you can monitor [him/her] from another room or out of the house and see what [he/she] gets up to.

To start, just get [him/her] in the car, with the car (parked and off) in your driveway. Sit in the car with [him/her], give [him/her] treats, pets, and praise. Get [him/her] comfortable with the idea of just being in the car.

			"text": "Fear of stairs is a pretty common problem we see with newly adopted dogs. Are your stairs open-backed (i.e. can you see through behind them?). This can be even more daunting for dogs who don’t have experience with stairs. Sometimes, just putting a large towel down on the stairs so [he/she] can’t see through the back will get [him/her] comfortable enough to traverse the stairs. After a while of walking up the stairs with the towel on them, usually dogs will get comfortable enough with them that the towel won’t be necessary.If that doesn’t do the trick, we will have to invest a little more time to desensitize [him/her] to the stairs. \n\nThe best way to help a dog with this phobia is to break down the process of going up and down the stairs into tiny chunks. Take extra time to work on this with your pup as a training exercise, as opposed to only dealing with it when you need [him/her] to use the stairs. We want to teach [him/her] that the stairs are not something to fear, and instead are where [he/she] gets lots of tasty treats. Start with some really special high value treats like hotdogs, cheese, freeze dried chicken or any kind of real meat that [he/she] really likes. It's best to do this when there isn't a lot of human traffic or other things going on that might also distract [him/her]. Start ten feet from the stairs, walk toward the stairs, stop a few feet away, give [him/her] a treat, praise [him/her] and turn around and walk back.  Repeat a couple of times. On the third time, walk right up to the stairs, give [him/her] a treat, praise [him/her] and walk back to the starting place. On the fourth time, put the treat on the first step. Walk back to the starting place (or you can start going to only 5 feet away). The next time put treats on the first and second steps. Repeat that step again. The next time, put the treat just on the third step. Stand there and ignore [him/her] and see if [he/she] will step up to get it.  If [he/she] does, give [him/her] really big praise, give [him/her] another treat and go back to the starting place. Repeat the third step again. Then if [he/she] is going up easily, move on to the next step. \n\nI would actually end the training there for the first session and give [him/her] a break by walking [him/her] around for a bit or going back inside. If at any point during this session, [he/she] balks, will not take the treat, or shows fear, break the training into even smaller steps and do more repetitions before moving on to the next part.  The next time you start the training, start from the beginning or at least start with just a treat on the first step and then turning around but try to end the training at least putting all four feet on the stairs. You shouldn't have to do every single step individually, and eventually, you can just try to get [him/her] to go all the rest of the way by holding the treat out in front as you make it up one landing.  Be sure to give [him/her] a lot of praise and a couple of treats when [he/she] makes it all the way up. You may actually have to start the same process again for each landing, but it should go faster each time.  Going downstairs should be easier, because you had to go downstairs to return to the starting spot, but [he/she] might be spooked at the top of the landing going down, so use a lure or put the treat on the first step. For some dogs this training can be very slow and might take several days during which you'll have to carry [him/her] up and down in between sessions, and some dogs get it much faster. Once they master it, though, it should be a done deal and you shouldn't have to carry them anymore.\n",

			"text": "It’s important to talk about dog communication, their subtle signals, and what those signals mean. Dogs communicate a lot differently than humans do. Their signals are a lot more subtle and a lot of their communications are done through body language. Dogs’ signals will usually escalate if they feel they’re not being heard. This means that if a dog is giving us signals but feels like those signals aren't being respected (maybe we don’t know what to look for and are just missing them), then they will intensify and change these signals to try and communicate their needs, dislikes, discomforts, etc. more clearly. \n\nDogs will typically start signaling that they are unhappy or uncomfortable by stiffening up their body, and/or giving what we call side-eye or \"whale-eye\" (when a dog is staring at a person or a dog but is not doing it head on, they are staring at them from the corner of their eye). If we ignore those signs and continue doing whatever it is that is making them uncomfortable, then they may resort to snarling or baring teeth. Again, if the dog feels like those signals aren't being respected they may escalate to growling. The growling usually will start as a low, quiet, rumbling growl. If that doesn't work then the dog may intensify their growls in volume and intensity. They may also choose to bark at this point to try and communicate even more clearly. If this growling and barking doesn't communicate the dog's needs clearly then they may at that point resort to pursuing the perceived threat a few feet while showing teeth, air snapping, or even biting. \n\nIt's important that dog owners have a clear understanding of what dog signals are, what they mean, and how they escalate. Even though we think of a lot of these signals as “bad” or threatening, we have to make sure we are respecting the signals a dog is giving us. If we ignore, disregard, or punish a signal, the dog will feel as though they have to resort to the next signal, which is even more intense than the previous one. If a dog gets to the point where they think biting is the only fool-proof signal, they will be less likely to give us those initial signals before going straight to biting, which is obviously not what we want or need. \n",

			"text": "I recommend keeping interruption tools readily available in case a disagreement does arise in the home between the dogs. These aversive tools would include a spray bottle, shake can (pennies in a metal tin or can), and Pet Corrector. The spray bottle is our lowest level of intervention. It can be used to interrupt or slow down play. For example, if the dogs are playing and you notice that things are getting a bit too amped, or one dog is starting to get a little too mouthy, or maybe one dog is getting too humpy and not listening to the other dogs signals, you can use your spray bottle to tell that specific dog to cut it out. Dogs usually don’t like getting sprayed with water, so it will break their focus without affecting the other dog. If you notice that the dog is not getting the hint with the spray bottle, it might be time to separate them for some cool down time. A shake can is typically a step up when it comes to interruptions because it makes a loud noise which can affect both dogs. You would use a shake can to interrupt or startle the dogs enough so that you can step in and separate. Pet Corrector is then a step up from the shake can and should only to be used during an emergency between the dogs and if you already tried spray bottle and shake can with no success. Pet Corrector is just compressed air so it is never harmful, but it makes a loud noise and is quite startling to dogs. The best approach to managing their interactions will be to be proactive about their playtimes and always monitor them while playing. I also encourage you to use drag leashes (lightweight leashes attached to their collars, just dragging on the ground) with your pups so that you can easily separate them if you need to.\n ",

Every time [he/she] gets excited, try to engage [him/her] with whatever toy [he/she] likes best.

The \"Teaching Your Dog Not to Jump\" video offers an exercise you can do with [him/her] during structured training times. It basically lets [name] practice how to respond appropriately (by not jumping) when being approached by a person. The handout will be helpful for more \"in the moment\" events. The basic principle for both situations is the same: [name] receives NO attention when [he/she] jumps (not even negative attention), and is rewarded when [he/she] doesn't jump. So when a new person appears and [he/she] jumps on them, you will ask them to turn away from [him/her] and stay away until [he/she] has all four feet on the ground, at which point you will let the new person reward [him/her] with praise and pets! When doing this in the home, I also recommend keeping a \"drag leash\" on [him/her] when [he/she] is meeting new people. A drag leash is just any normal, preferably lightweight, leash that is clipped to [his/her] collar, but you are not holding, so it just drags behind her as she walks. That way, whenever [he/she] gets jumpy, you have a point of contact to get [him/her] under control. So, if [he/she] jumps up toward the new person [he/she] is meeting, you can pick up the drag leash and steer [him/her] away while they turn away and deny [him/her] attention (what [he/she] wants). [He/She]'ll start to learn that if [he/she] keeps [his/her] cool, [he/she]'ll get to meet new people, but if [he/she] doesn't, [he/she]'ll get denied the attention.\n\nIf after a couple of weeks, [he/she] doesn't seem to have progressed at all, then you can move on to step two of the document, teaching an incompatible behavior -- sitting. It will be important to catch and reward even small moments of [name] doing the right thing, so [he/she] is able to learn what you want from [him/her].

So, for any dog, a big part of resolving this issue is not correcting it after it happens, but preventing them from getting that reward in the first place as much as possible. That may involve changing your habits--not leaving food in reach on the counter, which can be hard to remember--and it may involve some creative prevention. Is there a way to block [his/her] access to where the food is entirely with baby gates or x-pens? That way, if you are not around to closely supervise [him/her], [he/she] won't be able get to the counters and practice this bad behavior.  Another option is to use a crate while [he/she] is left alone so that [he/she] doesn't have the chance to do [his/her] counter surfing while you are not there to correct [him/her]. In order to properly correct this behavior, there are a few things you should do ahead of time, before you actually need to correct [him/her]. To start, I would recommend leaving a lightweight leash on [him/her] all the time for a while, and letting it drag on the ground, even while inside. We call that a \"drag leash.\" Next, pick out a word that you'll use for a verbal correction; we like 'eh-eh' or 'enough' because they're not words a dog hears often.

Give [him/her] a squirt of water across the rump, and use your verbal correction word. Your verbal command should be firm but neutral, as should the spray. The goal is not to scare the dog, but to pair the verbal correction and an unpleasant sensation (getting squirted with water), with the act of jumping on the counter. If that doesn't deter [him/her], this is when you will pick up [his/her] drag leash and walk [him/her] away from the counter. With repetition, [he/she] will learn that jumping up there results in an unpleasant experience (the squirt bottle and verbal correction). It's important to note that these corrections will only work if you catch [name] in the act, and not after. Even if [he/she] is still eating the food that [he/she] stole but [his/her] paws are on the ground, it is too late.

			"text": "The behavior of pulling, barking, or growling on leash in response to other animals, people, etc is called \"on leash reactivity.\" It's actually really common in dogs, and there are tried and true methods to work through it. I'm going to attach a document that goes over the basics on how to curb [his/her] rude behavior, but I'll touch on some points in this email too. To start, are you walking [him/her] just on a normal collar, or are you using any \"gear\" like a harness or Gentle Leader? Sometimes just getting some equipment can work wonders on dogs. We recommend either a Gentle Leader or a front clipping harness like an Easy Walk. If you want to talk in more detail about pros and cons of different equipment for walking, just let me know and we can talk through what is out there. \n\nThe goal of on leash reactivity training is to teach [name] a more appropriate response when [he/she] sees dogs on leash. We want to teach “replacement behaviors” that [name] will do instead of reacting. This is basically teaching [him/her] impulse control - to think before [he/she] gives in to [his/her] desire to react. A typical replacement behavior is [name] sitting by your side and \"checking in\" with you, aka looking at your face/giving you eye contact. The first step you'll want to do is work on [him/her] being able to perform \"sit\" on verbal in a calm, quiet environment (like inside your home). Check out the links in the document for how we teach sit and eye contact to get started. \n\nOnce [he/she] can do that consistently, we can start working through [his/her] behavior on leash. Like I said above, when you take [him/her] on walks, bring some high value treats along. When you see a person or dog, hopefully before [he/she] sees said person or dog, first try to create some distance - move off to the side of the trail, cross the street, just add some buffer space. Next ask [him/her] to \"sit\" and then reward [him/her] with treats and praise for sitting. Continue to make [him/her] hold [his/her] sit (you can use the \"stay\" command if [he/she] knows it or follow the techniques described in the APA sit videos) while the distraction passes by. Any time [he/she] looks at you instead of the dog or person, heavily praise and reward [him/her] with treats. Once they are gone, release [him/her] from holding [his/her] sit and carry on your walk.\n\nThe key to this training technique is consistency and a foundation in the basics. If [he/she] can't hold a sit/stay at home without distractions, there is very little hope [he/she] will be able to hold it while out on walks in the exciting world. So depending on where [he/she] is at in [his/her] obedience training, you may need to start working on this just in your home, then progress to the outdoors. Read through that document and start giving these techniques a go. Let me know if you have any questions on how to implement this. \n",

			"text": "Big Picture: I want to be able to ask my dog to sit and have [him/her] offer us eye contact while [his/her] trigger walks on by. Once the trigger has passed us we can move on.\n\nEquipment: I am curious to know what equipment you are currently walking your pup on? Are you using a flat collar, martingale collar, a front clipping harness, back clipping harness, or a Gentle Leader? When we are talking about different pieces of equipment we are mostly talking about where the dog is feeling pressure. You will see as we work through reactivity training that we use pressure a lot to communicate with dogs. We've come to learn that in moments of overarousal the words that come out of our mouths don't seem to register to dogs very well. In these moments we've learned that dogs do tend to be responsive to what they are feeling. \n\nWhen we are talking about highly reactive dogs or dogs who pull a lot, we most often suggest adopters/fosters use a gentle leader. Have you heard of a gentle leader before? A gentle leader is the equivalent of a bridle, which is used when walking or handling a horse - it loops around the dog’s nose. There are some misconceptions about a gentle leader. The biggest one being that a gentle leader is like a muzzle, which isn't true! When wearing a gentle leader a dog can eat, drink, play fetch, or even bite someone if they really wanted to. There are a couple of reasons we really like this tool. When wearing a gentle leader a dog is going to be feeling pressure up high behind their ears, and if they are really pulling or lunging then they will also feel a little pressure around their snout. This 'up high' pressure and pressure around their snout tends to be more meaningful and annoying for dogs to feel, which often results in them being more responsive to the pressure they are feeling. Not to mention that with a gentle leader a dog will often 'auto-correct' when they do lunge or have a negative reactive. This means that when a dog lunges or pulls really hard they will always feel the increased pressure, which signals to them that they’re making a mistake. \n\nWearing a gentle leader can be a little unnatural for dogs, so we often have to do some desensitization. HERE you will find a link with a really good video that teaches you how to desensitize your dog to this tool. We try to make positive associations with each step of putting the gentle leader on to help the pup start liking the gentle leader before actually wearing it or feeling pressure from it. \n\nIf you decide not to use a gentle leader (make sure you give it a try first!) and decide to use a harness, try to make sure that you are using a front clipping harness and not a back clipping harness. Dogs have an oppositional reflex, meaning that their center of gravity is located in the middle of their chest. When we use back clipping harnesses we are actually using that oppositional reflex against us. By clipping dogs in the back we are giving them the ability to use their chest muscles to pull forward, that's why you see sled dogs being clipped in the back. The theory behind a front clipping harness is to use that oppositional reflex in your favor and discourage your pup from pulling by having their equipment throw them a little off balance if they pull. \n\nIf you are simply using a collar, we suggest using a martingale collar vs. a flat collar. Martingale collars can tighten a little which will help ensure that your pup can't slip out of [his/her] collar if [he/she] is ever having an extremely reactive moment, but these collars don’t tighten enough to choke or harm a dog like some other equipment.  \n\nFundamental Skills:  When we are working reactivity we aren't really teaching dogs anything - we are using basic skills to change the emotional response that a dog is having to seeing a trigger (person, other dog, bike, car, etc.) There are two basic skills that we want to make sure we are mastering during reactivity work: sit and eye contact. \n\nEye Contact: Let's start off talking about eye contact. We consider eye-contact to be the most rewardable behavior. If we can get a dog to check in with us readily, then it gives us ample opportunity to give said dog direction and instructions. We often see a lot of mainstream trainers teach eye contact as a cue or command, meaning that they have a word, silly noise, or hand signal that is supposed to signal the dog to stop what they are doing and look up at their handler. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but it doesn't work for the training that we are doing. If your pup is hard staring, barking, lunging, etc. at another dog, you can't say 'look at me' and expect [him/her] to stop dead in [his/her] tracks and offer eye contact. At APA, we teach dogs to offer us eye contact on their own vs. us having to solicit it. This puts most of the responsibility on the dogs during stressful times and allows us to train them to look to us for positive reinforcement. \n\nWe want dogs to be able to look at a trigger and then decide to look up at us for guidance, giving us deference. There are two games that we play to start teaching dogs to offer us eye contact. The first exercise that we work through is a game that we call the 'made you look game':\n\nThe video above teaches you how we start working through this game. We want to make sure that we are starting to play this game indoors where the distractions are really low and your pup is really comfortable. Once you reach a point where you set your hands out in front of you to play this game and [name] stares straight into your soul, [he/she] gets it and you can start challenging them with more distracting scenarios. You want to make sure that you are adding the distractions really slowly. \n\nThe second game that we play, which is used to help generalize the idea that giving us eye contact makes good stuff happen, is called the capture game. Here's a video on how we play this game:\n\nFor this game you'll be storing treats up high in different rooms of your home. As you go through your day to day life, if you're making a sandwich, brushing your teeth, etc. and happen to notice that you and your pup make eye contact, you can quickly mark (say the cue “yes”) and then reward them with a treat. It doesn't matter if it takes you a second or two to get the treat to your pup. The 'yes' verbal marker will make the correlation on why the pup is being given a treat. \n\nSit: The second basic skill that we want to master is sit. [name] probably knows sit already in some capacity. When we are working on sit in the context of reactivity work, there are going to be a couple of extra rules that we are going to be instilling. First off, from here on out sit comes with an implied stay. This means that when you ask [name] to sit, the expectation is that [he/she] holds [his/her] booty on the ground until told otherwise. We also need to have a word or “cue” which releases [him/her] from the sit - at APA we use the word 'free'. Lastly, we are no longer going to be using treats to reward sitting; it's too easy. We're going to be reserving the treats for the really hard stuff, which is giving us eye contact/deference, especially around [his/her] triggers. (Feel free to use verbal praise when [name] listens to a sit cue. You can tell [him/her] [he/she]'s beautiful, wonderful, and amazing. Throw in a pet or two if you'd like, but remember we're saving the good stuff for the more valuable skill.) \n\nWe obviously need some sort of way to instill these new rules. We use “pressure and release” - have you ever heard of this concept? \n\nPressure and release spelled out: We are going to be asking [name] to sit once verbally. The reason we only ask [him/her] to sit one time is because we need [him/her] to know that we mean business the first time around. We are going to be using these skills in compromising situations where [name] is around dogs or people whom [he/she] typically reacts towards, we don't have time to repeat ourselves or wrestle with the [him/her] to make [him/her] sit. \n\nIf your pup sits then pops right back up, or completely ignores you, you will (very slowly and very gradually) start adding leash pressure straight up to the sky with your leash. This isn't meant to hurt or lift [name] off the ground - it's meant to be a little annoying as [he/she] is feeling this pressure, maybe a little uncomfortable as well. As soon as [he/she] sits down and puts [his/her] booty on the floor, all of the pressure goes away. We do this to communicate to [him/her] that if [he/she] feels any pressure [he/she] is doing something wrong, and if [he/she] doesn’t feel pressure then [he/she] is doing the right thing. \n\nThe two videos above teach you how to work through pressure and release exercises to start enforcing sit with its new rules. When you are starting to teach this, if you reach a point where you are about to lift the dog off the ground, stop adding pressure. Instead, hold the pressure at 'maximum pressure' and start adding a little downward pressure to the pups butt as a secondary signal of what we want from them. As soon as [his/her] butt hits the floor we again release all of the pressure. \n\nMultitasking: Lastly, I want to quickly chat about starting to put these two skills together. (Make sure that you are mastering them individually at first, it'll make your life SO much easier.) Work through the sit exercises, making sure that you are not repeating yourself if/when your dog pops up out of [his/her] sit and instead only using pressure and release to cue [him/her] back to sitting. If your dog offers you eye contact while [he/she] is seated, you should use that 'y-e-s' work to mark this good behavior, and make sure that they are treated/rewarded right afterwards. \n\nYou want to make sure that you are practicing all of this inside of your home at first, where the distractions are low and your pup is really comfortable. Once [he/she] masters these skills indoors without any distractions, increase the difficulty level really slowly. For example: start off practicing multitasking inside your home without any distractions. Once [he/she] masters this, do the same thing but with the blinds open, or with the TV on, or with a friend moving about the kitchen - and so on and so forth! \n\nWe spend a lot of time in reactivity class teaching the humans involved and helping them become better handlers - half the battle here is empowering you to understand how to handle [name]. Obviously, with all of the COVID-19 stuff going on we aren't able to meet in person and help you really become comfortable with working through all of these skills. We are trying our best to continue to support people, their pups, and their behavior needs through these unusual times. I super encourage you to film yourself working the multitasking that we talked about. Send that video over to me and I will be more than happy to give you pointers on things we can try differently to ensure further success. Please don't be shy! I'm here to help! \n\nLastly (promise this is the last one) I want you to keep in mind that your pup still isn't “fixed” and you are still in the land of avoidance and management. This means that you should be walking away and trying to avoid other dogs or triggers as often as possible. We want to intentionally start teaching our pups what we want them to do and make sure those skills are super solid before we start saying 'no don't do that'. Think of it in human terms, if you started a new job where you had no training but people started to get upset with you when you messed up-- you'd probably be pretty over it and quit fairly soon too! \n",

To start, are you walking [him/her] just on [his/her] normal collar, or are you using any \"gear\" like a harness or Gentle Leader? Sometimes just getting some equipment can work wonders on dogs.

Next, when you’re walking, we recommend bringing along some high value treats, like cheese, chicken, or hot dogs.

The trickiest part is understanding what the \"quick\" is, and how far to cut the nails. The \"quick\" is simply living tissue that extends partway into the dog's nail. For dogs that have not had their nails cut frequently, the quick is usually longer; the more often nails are cut (still not hitting the quick), the more the quick recedes, or shortens, so we can cut more of the nail. We don't want to cut the quick because it can hurt a bit (similar to if you cut your nail too short) and causes bleeding. Usually, the first few times you cut a dog's nails, you should cut just a tiny amount off of the nail to avoid hitting the quick. If we cut a dog's nails relatively often, the quick will recede naturally so the nails can get cut shorter. Does [name] have black nails, or white/off colored nails? Cutting white/clear/off color nails are easier, because you can see the quick and avoid it easier. However, with black nails, you just cut less more conservatively and take less off. Check out the pictures below for an outline of what the quick is, along with a picture of an actual nail so you can visualize it better. \n",

Start by just having the clippers out within view; some dogs may have a negative association with the clippers and will take some time just getting over their fear. If [he/she] doesn’t mind the clippers, move to the next step. Gently touch the nail with the clippers, pull them away, let go of the paw, and give a treat.

Other dogs will guard items from people but are ok sharing them with other dogs. Lastly, some dogs will guard items from both dogs and people.  \n\nAnother variable to resource guarding is what the dog will guard. Often times people think about resource guarding related to food, which is a common one but some dogs will guard other things. Other common examples of things a dog might guard are chew bones, toys, dog beds, or even abstract things like space and attention from a favorite person. Some dogs will only guard one or two specific things but other times dogs might be more generalized in the things they guard which means they guard multiple different things.  \n\nOne final variable to resource guarding is how the dog guards. There are various things a dog might do to indicate guarding behavior. They could get more stiff and still in their body and kind of hover over the item, maybe stop eating or chewing momentarily. Other signs are showing teeth, growling, barking, snapping or biting. In some cases a dog might actually leave the item to charge towards the approaching person/ animal while growling, barking or snapping to drive them away. Some dogs will only show signs of guarding if the person/ animal is in really close proximity to them with the item, such as trying to touch them or take the item. Other dogs will show signs of guarding from more of a distance like if someone just passes by a few feet away or more. \n\nIt is really helpful to narrow down these variables, for your particular dog, so that we know how to proceed with addressing the behavior. \n",

			"text": "When it comes to resource guarding behavior, there are really just two options for dealing with it, management or training. Management is an option that many people choose if their dog is only guarding 1-2 specific things. For example, if your dog is guarding a chew bone or rawhide, then you can manage the behavior by simply not giving the dog this item. You avoid the issue and any possible negative impacts by simply not allowing the dog to have it. \n\nIf a dog is guarding something from a human then there are training exercises we can set up to help teach the dog that guarding is not necessary. This training protocol is detailed and broken into very small baby steps that may take weeks or even months to work through but is intended to help the dog learn that guarding is not needed. This training protocol is really only useful if the dog is guarding things from humans. If your dog is guarding items from other animals then training becomes a more difficult and less realistic option.  \n\nWhen it comes to dog's guarding from other dogs there is really no training that we can do to try and communicate to the dog who is guarding that the dog doesn't pose a threat. In order to be able to change the emotional response that a dog is having to potentially having to share food, toys, affection or attention we need to be able to control at least one of the variables involved. Which means that we need to be able to instruct one of the dogs involved on when to freeze, when to walk away, where to move, etc. Our only option when we are working with a dog that guards from other dogs is management. \n",

Sometimes we see this kind of anxiety reduce on its own once the dog has some \"decompression\" time in the home. Other times, dogs need a little help to realize that being alone isn’t all that scary. I am going to attach a resource that walks through some techniques to help curb separation anxiety. It will take some time, consistency, and patience on your part to get [him/her] to a point where [he/she] can be left alone without anxiety, but it is possible.\n",

			"text": "I am going to provide you a few resources to look through to start working on this behavior with [name]. One is our general guideline on working through separation anxiety, another is a document on crate training, and the last is a document on \"Canine Enrichment,\" aka ways to occupy your dog while you are home. These documents will go into more detail than I will in this email, but I will quickly touch on some points that may help. There are a few things you can try right away to ease your pup's mind a bit. Playing white noise while you're gone can be helpful for dogs who get anxious hearing outside noises. Other dogs find comfort in cuddling with a shirt or other item of clothing that smells like you. Some dogs just need something to distract them, like a long-lasting treat such as a Kong stuffed with treats/kibble/peanut butter. The \"Canine Enrichment\" document will provide you with some creative solutions to distract dogs with food. \n\nFor many dogs, working through separation anxiety will take dedicated time and practice, just like training a dog to sit, stay, or lay down would. While the quick changes I mentioned can help a bit, it is unlikely that those changes alone will make [name] totally comfortable being alone. Instead, we have to spend time \"practicing\" leaving the house in order to desensitize [him/her] to your leaving. The separation anxiety document will walk you through those steps. \n\nWe also encourage you to crate train your dog. \"Crate training\" is more than just buying a crate and crating your dog while you're away; it is teaching your dog that their crate is their safe place, their place they can feel safe and happy. If introduced correctly, crating can be a safe way to ensure [name] is not being destructive while you are away, and even provide some comfort to [him/her]. Some dogs really take to the crate and like to snooze in there in their free time because it is their \“room.\” Check out the crate training document for more details on how to make the crate a positive place for your pup. We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. If possible, arrange your departures to be right as you put down [his/her] food, so [he/she] can focus on food instead of being stressed about your departure. Also, try to make your arrivals as low-key as possible. Ignore [name] for the first few minutes you get home. We want to teach [him/her] it is not exciting that you arrive home. Once [he/she] settles a bit, then you can calmly acknowledge [him/her]. Slowly breaking down the excitement/anxiety of your departures and arrivals is crucial to diminishing separation anxiety.\n",

			"text": "My first suggestion is to work with [name] on crate training. When a dog is introduced to the crate properly, crating can help reduce anxiety because they see their crate as a safe place. Dogs naturally like to \"den\", so a crate can be just that for them. I've attached our crate training document that walks through how to acclimate [him/her] to the crate step by step and make it a place [he/she] wants to hang out. I'd also recommend giving [him/her] something to keep [his/her] mind occupied while in the crate, so I've attached our Canine Enrichment document with ideas for how to keep [him/her] busy and tire out [his/her] brain. \n\nNext, you may consider trying a thundershirt. It can help reduce storm anxiety in many dogs. If you get [him/her] one, I would recommend occasionally putting it on [him/her] on days when it isn't storming, so [he/she] doesn't start equating that a thundershirt=a scary thing is about to happen. Additionally, I would suggest try playing different types of white noise during the storm, such as getting a loud fan running, playing a radio, or just running the tv. Getting [him/her] plenty of exercise if you know the forecast calls for a storm is another way to help preemptively avoid anxiety. You may also try restricting [him/her] to internal rooms like a closet or bathroom during the storm. It's just not a behavior you're probably ever going to get rid of, so finding the right combinations of management is your best bet.\n\nFinally, you may also want to speak to your vet about options for medication or calming supplements to use during storms. Lots of dogs with storm anxiety have anti-anxiety medications that are administered just for thunderstorms, and they can help quite a bit. In addition, our APA adopter’s alumni group is a great place to crowdsource personal experiences on coping with storm anxiety.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/AustinPetsAliveAdopters/.",

			"text": "It is not unusual for a dog to be more anxious in the beginning as they are decompressing from the shelter and acclimating to their new environment and human. Pacing, panting, and the inability to settle down are all typical signs of anxiety in dogs. Dogs like routines; they are creatures of habit. Right now, [name]’s routines have been all shaken up, so [he/she] may be feeling a bit uncertain. It will take some patience and love on your part while [name] realizes that [he/she] has made it to [his/her] forever home.\n\nIn the meantime, know that this anxious behavior is normal. It can be stressful for you, as the human, to watch [him/her] not be able to relax, but try not to let it bother you too much. There are a few things you can do to help [name] acclimate faster. First, try to establish a routine for [name]. Wake up, feed, and walk [him/her] around the same times, so [he/she] can expect what is going to happen in [his/her] life. Next, try to avoid causing extra stress through activities that we may think are fun or necessary, but to dogs are just overwhelming. This could be taking a trip to the pet store, getting a bath, or meeting a lot of new people. Try to keep things calm and predictable at first, and as [he/she] settles in, start introducing [him/her] to more exciting things. Overall, the key here is just giving [name] time to decompress, and to respect [his/her] space and feelings as [he/she] adjusts to this huge change in [his/her] life. \n",
