I’ll briefly talk through the general points presented in the document, but for more detail, check it out. Basically, the first week we don’t want to try to introduce them at all. Transitions are stressful for dogs, so giving [name] a little time to settle in and adjust to [his/her] new environment before introducing them would allow [him/her] to be a little calmer, which can be helpful. During this time, you could also start working on some basic obedience (specifically \"sit\") which will be helpful in this process. Once [name] has settled in, you can do the first real stage of the introductions. You’ll have your dog on leash, and have the cat in the room, preferably contained in a large dog crate or something along those lines, so they can’t get too close to the dog if they want to. While they’re \"interacting\" like this (in the same room, but not close to each other or actually touching), work on rewarding [name] for ignoring the cat and paying attention to you. We basically want to desensitize [him/her] to their presence, so the cat isn’t exciting or something to be worked up about. Continue these exercises of them just existing in the same space, slowly decreasing the space between the two, and look for [name] consistently ignoring or showing calm behavior around the cat. After a week or two of this, move to the next stage, which is letting the cats roam free while [name] is still on leash. Continue to look for appropriate behaviors, and work on letting them get closer. Eventually you’ll transition to letting go of the leash. Keep the leash on [name], but let it drag on the ground. If [he/she] tries to chase the cat, you can step on the leash and halt [him/her] from running. Always supervise them together, and make sure that the cat has lots of \"escape routes\" that the dog cannot follow - baby gates between rooms, cat trees, counters etc. If the cat tries to communicate to [name] to back off (hissing, swatting, etc), make sure [he/she] listens to the cat. If [he/she] continues to try to play/pester the cat when the cat is telling [him/her] to back off, you should step in and back your cat up.

To start, it’s important to set [name] up for success as best you can. This means removing items from [his/her] reach that [he/she] might try to chew. If [he/she] only has good choices to choose from, [he/she] will get in the habit of picking the right objects. Along with that, you should make sure [he/she] has plenty of other appropriate things to chew on, like toys and bones, so [he/she] can get that chewing urge out in a healthy way. When [he/she] chooses to chew on those, praise [him/her], play with [him/her], do whatever makes [him/her] happy. This will teach [him/her] that chewing on appropriate things results in praise and fun. Another helpful thing will be to teach \"drop\" or \"leave it,\" so when [he/she] gets something that is inappropriate, you can ask for it back without it turning into a game of chase or tug of war. Also, make sure only to correct [him/her] (using verbal corrections like \"no\" or \"eh eh\") while [he/she]’s in the act of chewing something, not afterwards. Getting the timing of the correction down is important, so [he/she] understands that what [he/she]  is doing in that moment is not appropriate. Dogs won’t understand why they are getting scolded if you don’t catch them in the act. They may still act sheepish, but they really don’t connect the dots that the punishment is due to something that happened earlier in the day, so the behavior won't change. For more tips and details, I'm attaching our go-to document on chewing, which has some additional techniques to try to curb this behavior. Depending on how destructive [his/her] chewing is (i.e. ruining entire couches or just lightly munching a shoe) some of the tips may be overkill. Nonetheless, it’s a good resource to start with.

To do this, you may need to leave a breadcrumb trail of high value treats (chicken, cheese, hot dog, salami, etc.) into the back of the crate.

Check out the \"Canine Enrichment\" document I'm attaching for some easy ways to make [him/her] work a little harder on [his/her] food while [he/she] is in the crate. This is beneficial because it channels [his/her] focus into doing something healthy and productive, as opposed to focusing on the fact that [he/she] is stuck in the crate. Also, I would recommend securing the joints of the crate with zip ties. Sometimes dogs bend the metal of the crate enough to be able to escape; using zip ties will make this very difficult to do. If the crate is not showing signs of bending like that, [he/she] may have just figured out how to undo the latch from the inside (if so [he/she] is a smart cookie!). Check out the tutorial on how to \"spy\" on [him/her] via Skype. If you can set that up, you can monitor [him/her] from another room or out of the house and see what [he/she] gets up to.

I'll walk through the process for car riding, but know that this process can be used for anything that [he/she] is scared of. To start, just get [him/her] in the car, with the car (parked and off) in your driveway. Sit in the car with [him/her], give [him/her] treats, pets, and praise. Get [him/her] comfortable with the idea of just being in the car.

Hang out in there for like 15 minutes, then just come back inside.

If [he/she] seeks comfort from human touch, have someone hanging out in the backseat with [him/her]; make sure again [he/she] has plenty of treats and stuff to entertain [him/her] in the car. Monitor [him/her] for signs of stress; if [he/she] is panting, drooling, or acting panicky, then you may need to backstep a bit and go back to just hanging out with the car on. This process can take some time, and it's important to really pay attention to [his/her] signs that [he/she] is overwhelmed. The idea is to keep [him/her] below [his/her] fear threshold in the car, and give [him/her] lots of tasty treats and love, so [he/she] stops associating cars with stress, and instead associates it with fun and snacks.

			"text": "This is always a challenging behavior to correct because the \"reward\" dogs get for counter surfing, stolen human food, is such a strong reward that the behavior really reinforces itself. So, for any dog, a big part of resolving this issue is not correcting it after it happens, but preventing them from getting that reward in the first place as much as possible. That may involve changing your habits--not leaving food in reach on the counter, which can be hard to remember--and it may involve some creative prevention. Is there a way to block [his/her] access to where the food is entirely with baby gates or x-pens? That way, if you are not around to closely supervise [him/her], [he/she] won't be able get to the counters and practice this bad behavior.  Another option is to use a crate while [he/she] is left alone so that [he/she] doesn't have the chance to do [his/her] counter surfing while you are not there to correct [him/her]. In order to properly correct this behavior, there are a few things you should do ahead of time, before you actually need to correct [him/her]. To start, I would recommend leaving a lightweight leash on [him/her] all the time for a while, and letting it drag on the ground, even while inside. We call that a \"drag leash.\" Next, pick out a word that you'll use for a verbal correction; we like 'eh-eh' or 'enough' because they're not words a dog hears often. Last, get a small spray bottle filled with water. If/when you catch [him/her] in the act of counter surfing, use your spray bottle filled with water to startle [him/her] out of her behavior and get [him/her] to cut it out. Give [him/her] a squirt of water across the rump, and use your verbal correction word. Your verbal command should be firm but neutral, as should the spray. The goal is not to scare the dog, but to pair the verbal correction and an unpleasant sensation (getting squirted with water), with the act of jumping on the counter. If that doesn't deter [him/her], this is when you will pick up [his/her] drag leash and walk [him/her] away from the counter. With repetition, [he/she] will learn that jumping up there results in an unpleasant experience (the squirt bottle and verbal correction). It's important to note that these corrections will only work if you catch [name] in the act, and not after. Even if [he/she] is still eating the food that [he/she] stole but [his/her] paws are on the ground, it is too late.

			"text": "The behavior of pulling, barking, or growling on leash in response to other animals, people, etc is called \"on leash reactivity.\" This behavior is actually really common in dogs, and there are tried and true methods to work through it. To start, are you walking [him/her] just on [his/her] normal collar, or are you using any \"gear\" like a harness or Gentle Leader? Sometimes just getting some equipment can work wonders on dogs. We recommend either a Gentle Leader or a front clipping harness like an Easy Walk. If you want to talk in more detail about pros and cons of different equipment for walking, just let me know and we can talk through what is out there. While we can’t directly change how [name] feels in response to [his/her] triggers on leash, we can teach [him/her] a more appropriate response. We want to teach “replacement behaviors” that [name] will do instead of reacting. Typical replacement behaviors include having your dog sit calmly next to you and giving eye contact (aka “checking in”) when they see the dog/person/etc that usually elicits their reactivity. Don’t expect [name] to be able to perform these replacement behaviors right away, but with some time and effort on your part, [he/she] will learn that this new behavior is the preferable option. The first step you'll want to do is work on her being able to perform \"sit\" on verbal in a calm, quiet environment (like inside your home). Check out the videos I attached to this emails on working on sitting with distractions and for duration. Once [he/she] can do that consistently, we can start working through [his/her] behavior on leash. When you take [him/her] on walks, I suggest you start bringing treats along. Make sure they are high enough in value to [him/her] that she will be interested in them even with distractions around (this may mean the treats need to be cheese, chicken, or some other special thing [he/she] doesn't usually get). When you see a person or dog, hopefully before [he/she] sees said person or dog, first try to create some distance - move off to the side of the trail, cross the street, just add some buffer space. Next ask [him/her] to \"sit\" and then reward [him/her] with treats and praise for sitting. Continue to make [him/her] hold [his/her] sit (you can use the \"stay\" command if [he/she] knows it) while the distraction passes by. Any time [he/she] looks at you instead of the dog or person, heavily praise and reward [him/her] with treats. Once they are gone, release [him/her] from holding [his/her] sit and carry on your walk. I’m going to attach another video that goes over teaching that eye contact is a rewardable behavior; this is really helpful because if [he/she] is looking at you for treats, [he/she] is not reacting at the people/dogs. The key to this training technique is consistency and a foundation in the basics. If [he/she] can't hold a sit/stay at home without distractions, there is very little hope [he/she] will be able to hold it while out on walks in the exciting world. So depending on where [he/she] is at in her obedience training, you may need to start working on this just in your home, then progress to the outdoors.",

Usually it takes puppies till they're around 6 months or older before they really consistently get potty training down. If [he/she] is occasionally having accidents in the house, but generally starting to understand that [he/she] should go outside, then you are on the right track. I’m attaching our \"Puppy Basics\" document, which has a section dedicated specifically to helping work through potty training. Look through that and let me know if you have any questions on how to implement those techniques. The most important takeaways from that document are to set a schedule/routine and take [him/her] out often. Dogs thrive on routines, so getting [him/her] to a point where [he/she] expects to be let out will go a long way to motivate [him/her] to hold [his/her] business. Make sure you praise [him/her] when [he/she] goes outside, and don’t punish [him/her] if [he/she] does potty indoors. If you scold [him/her] for going indoors, [he/she] could start being scared to go potty in front of you at all, even outdoors, which is definitely not what we want. Instead, if/when [he/she] does have an accident indoors, try to catch [him/her] in the act and take [him/her] outside immediately, where you reward [him/her] for finishing up [his/her] business. This way, [he/she] learns that pottying indoors gets interrupted, but pottying outdoors gets rewarded! I want to note that even if you’re doing everything right, it can take a while for puppies to fully understand and master potty training, so don’t worry if [he/she] has slip ups sometimes. Just continue to follow the guidelines, reward good choices, and interrupt [him/her] when [he/she] potties indoors.",

			"text": "I’m sorry to hear that you are having issues with [name] chewing on inappropriate items. This behavior, while certainly obnoxious and problematic, is quite common with puppies. In general, dogs use their mouths to explore the world, and puppies even moreso. It’s up to us as their owners to teach puppies what is and is not appropriate to chew on. To start, it’s important to set [name] up for success as best you can. This means removing items from [his/her] reach that [he/she] might try to chew. If [he/she] only has good choices to choose from, [he/she] will get in the habit of picking the right objects. Along with that, you should make sure [he/she] has plenty of other appropriate things to chew on, like toys and bones, so [he/she] can get that chewing urge out in a healthy way. When [he/she] chooses to chew on those, praise [him/her], play with [him/her], do whatever makes [him/her] happy. This will teach [him/her] that chewing on appropriate things results in praise and fun. I’m attaching a document to this email called “Puppy Basics.” It has a specific section that walks through how to curb this behavior in more detail.

			"text": "I’m sorry that you’re having some problems with [name]’s jumpy behavior. Jumpiness in dogs is a fairly common problem, especially in puppies - it is a natural expression of enthusiasm and excitement, and puppies are full of that! We want to teach them that jumping is not an appropriate way to show their enthusiasm, and will not get them what they want. There are a few things you can do to work on curbing this behavior. You can teach [name] an incompatible behavior, like \"sit,\" so when [he/she] goes to jump on you, you ask [him/her] for a sit instead. This in turn rewards [him/her] for [his/her] good behavior when [he/she] sits, and breaks the habit of jumping up when excited. Another technique you can try is just completely ignoring [him/her] when [he/she] jumps. If [he/she] is jumping for attention, and then gets the exact opposite of that every time [he/she] jumps, [he/she] will soon learn jumping is not a good way to get what [he/she] wants. Along this train of thought, be sure to reward [him/her] for polite behavior. Teach [name] that calm behavior results in attention, praise, and pets, while jumpy behavior results in the absence of all of those.

Puppies naturally use their mouths to communicate and explore the world, so it is not unusual to hear of problems with inappropriate nipping, but boy do they have some sharp teeth. While mouthing is an appropriate and acceptable way to communicate in the dog world, it doesn't work out too well for us in the human world! We as the humans have to teach puppies that what is appropriate communication with dogs is not always appropriate with humans -- mainly that they can't chomp on us when they are playing. I am going to attach a document to this email that is called “Puppy Basics.” It specifically has a section that walks through how to curb this behavior. There are a couple main takeaways that I’ll quickly walk through here, but I encourage you to read through the document, as it goes into this in a bit more depth. To start, you always want to have items that are appropriate for [name] to chew on close by. That way, when [he/she] goes to grab on to you when you’re playing, you can offer [him/her] a toy instead. If [he/she] engages with the toy, be sure to reward that behavior by praising [him/her] and continuing to play with [him/her]. If [he/she] will not be distracted by a toy, then you should ignore [him/her] when [he/she] starts to get mouthy. Don’t scold, just stand up, look away, and become a statue. Pretend [he/she] doesn’t exist. This way, [he/she] learns that grabbing a toy results in continued play (good), but grabbing you results in the end of play and all attention (bad).",

One is our general guideline on working through separation anxiety, another is a document on crate training, and the last is a document on \"Canine Enrichment,\" aka ways to occupy your dog while you are home. Read through all these and let me know if you have any questions on the content. These documents will go into more detail than I will in this email, but I will quickly touch on some points that may help. In terms of separation anxiety, there are a few things you can try right away to ease your pup's mind a bit. Playing white noise while you're gone can be helpful for dogs who get anxious hearing outside noises. Other dogs find comfort in cuddling with a shirt or other item of clothing that smells like you. Some dogs just need something to distract them, like a long-lasting treat such as a Kong stuffed with treats/kibble/peanut butter. The \"Canine Enrichment\" document will provide you with some creative solutions to distract dogs with food. We also encourage you to crate train your dog. \"Crate training\" is more than just buying a crate and crating your dog while you're away; this is teaching your dog that their crate is their safe place, their place they can feed safe and happy. If introduced correctly, crating can be a safe way to ensure [name] is not being destructive while you are away, and even provide some comfort to [him/her]. Some dogs really take to the crate and like to snooze in there in their free time because it is their \"room.\" Check out the crate training document for more details on how to make the crate a positive place for your pup. We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. If possible, arrange your departures to be right as you put down [his/her] food, so [he/she] can focus on food instead of being stressed about your departure. Also, try to make your arrivals as low-key as possible. Ignore [name] for the first few minutes you get home. We want to teach [him/her] it is not exciting that you arrive home. Once [he/she] settles a bit, then you can calmly acknowledge [him/her]. Slowly breaking down the excitement/anxiety of your departures and arrivals is crucial to diminishing separation anxiety.",
