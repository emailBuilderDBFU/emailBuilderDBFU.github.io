			"text": "I'm going to attach our cat-dog introduction document on this email for your reference. I’ll briefly talk through the general points presented in the document, but for more detail, check it out. Basically, the first week we don’t want to try to introduce them at all. Transitions are stressful for dogs, so giving [name] a little time to settle in and adjust to [his/her] new environment before introducing them would allow [him/her] to be a little calmer, which can be helpful. During this time, you could also start working on some basic obedience (specifically \"sit\") which will be helpful in this process. Once [name] has settled in, you can do the first real stage of the introductions. You’ll have your dog on leash, and have the cat in the room, preferably contained in a large dog crate or something along those lines, so they can’t get too close to the dog if they want to. While they’re \"interacting\" like this (in the same room, but not close to each other or actually touching), work on rewarding [name] for ignoring the cat and paying attention to you. We basically want to desensitize [him/her] to their presence, so the cat isn’t exciting or something to be worked up about. Continue these exercises of them just existing in the same space, slowly decreasing the space between the two, and look for [name] consistently ignoring or showing calm behavior around the cat. After a week or two of this, move to the next stage, which is letting the cats roam free while [name] is still on leash. Continue to look for appropriate behaviors, and work on letting them get closer. Eventually you’ll transition to letting go of the leash. Keep the leash on [name], but let it drag on the ground. If [he/she] tries to chase the cat, you can step on the leash and halt [him/her] from running. Always supervise them together, and make sure that the cat has lots of \"escape routes\" that the dog cannot follow - baby gates between rooms, cat trees, counters etc. If the cat tries to communicate to [name] to back off (hissing, swatting, etc), make sure [he/she] listens to the cat. If [he/she] continues to try to play/pester the cat when the cat is telling [him/her] to back off, you should step in and back your cat up. Again, check out the document for more detail, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or want to talk through this in more detail.\n",

			"text": "This behavior is pretty common in dogs, which luckily means that there are plenty of techniques you can use to curb it! To start, it’s important to set [name] up for success as best you can. This means removing items from [his/her] reach that [he/she] might try to chew. If [he/she] only has good choices to choose from, [he/she] will get in the habit of picking the right objects. Along with that, you should make sure [he/she] has plenty of other appropriate things to chew on, like toys and bones, so [he/she] can get that chewing urge out in a healthy way. When [he/she] chooses to chew on those, praise [him/her], play with [him/her], do whatever makes [him/her] happy. This will teach [him/her] that chewing on appropriate things results in praise and fun. Another helpful thing will be to teach \"drop\" or \"leave it,\" so when [he/she] gets something that is inappropriate, you can ask for it back without it turning into a game of chase or tug of war. Also, make sure only to correct [him/her] (using verbal corrections like \"no\" or \"eh eh\") while [he/she]’s in the act of chewing something, not afterwards. Getting the timing of the correction down is important, so [he/she] understands that what [he/she]  is doing in that moment is not appropriate. Dogs won’t understand why they are getting scolded if you don’t catch them in the act. They may still act sheepish, but they really don’t connect the dots that the punishment is due to something that happened earlier in the day, so the behavior won't change. For more tips and details, I'm attaching our go-to document on chewing, which has some additional techniques to try to curb this behavior. Depending on how destructive [his/her] chewing is (i.e. ruining entire couches or just lightly munching a shoe) some of the tips may be overkill. Nonetheless, it’s a good resource to start with. Look through that document and let me know if you have any questions.\n",

If introduced correctly, crating can be a safe way to ensure [name] is not being destructive while you are away, and provide [him/her] with their own personal \"room\" they can hang out in, unbothered. We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. Toss treats in the crate when your pup isn’t around, so next time [he/she] checks out the crate, treats have magically appeared. Ideally, you’d have the time to slowly acclimate [name] to the crate over days or weeks before having to put [him/her] in there for a longer period of time. However, that is usually not feasible, but there are still steps you can take to ensure that you are doing all you can to avoid regressing on training when you have to crate [him/her]. Never force [him/her] into the crate; always let [him/her] go in on [his/her] own. To do this, you may need to leave a breadcrumb trail of high value treats (chicken, cheese, hot dog, salami, etc.) into the back of the crate. Also, whenever you have to leave [him/her] in the crate, make sure [he/she] has plenty to do to occupy [his/her] time. Put some of [his/her] favorite toys in there and a long lasting treat, like a kong. Check out the crate training document for more details on how to make the crate a positive place for your pup.\n",

I have a couple resources for you to look at that will help us get [him/her] more comfortable in the crate, being alone in general, and help prevent [him/her] from busting of the crate in the first place. Check out these documents and see if there are any techniques in there that you can use. A tip that can be really helpful is to try to occupy [his/her] attention with something positive while [he/she] is in the crate. If you're not already, feed [him/her] in his crate, and make feeding a bit more of a game for [him/her]. Check out the \"Canine Enrichment\" document I'm attaching for some easy ways to make [him/her] work a little harder on [his/her] food while [he/she] is in the crate. This is beneficial because it channels [his/her] focus into doing something healthy and productive, as opposed to focusing on the fact that [he/she] is stuck in the crate. Also, I would recommend securing the joints of the crate with zip ties. Sometimes dogs bend the metal of the crate enough to be able to escape; using zip ties will make this very difficult to do. If the crate is not showing signs of bending like that, [he/she] may have just figured out how to undo the latch from the inside (if so [he/she] is a smart cookie!). Check out the tutorial on how to \"spy\" on [him/her] via Skype. If you can set that up, you can monitor [him/her] from another room or out of the house and see what [he/she] gets up to.

I'll walk through the process for car riding, but know that this process can be used for anything that [he/she] is scared of. To start, just get [him/her] in the car, with the car (parked and off) in your driveway. Sit in the car with [him/her], give [him/her] treats, pets, and praise. Get [him/her] comfortable with the idea of just being in the car. If [he/she] has a special bone that [he/she] likes, let [him/her] chew it in the car; use special treats like chicken, cheese, or hot dogs while you're in the car. Hang out in there for like 15 minutes, then just come back inside. Repeat this, with the car off, until [he/she] is comfortable getting in and just chilling in the car with you; [he/she] should start looking forward to hanging out in the car because it means special treats and cuddling time. This could take a lot of sessions, so be patient. Let [him/her] set the pace. Once [he/she] is comfortable like that, repeat that process, but turn the car on.

Drive around for a short (<5 minutes) time with [him/her]. If [he/she] seeks comfort from human touch, have someone hanging out in the backseat with [him/her]; make sure again [he/she] has plenty of treats and stuff to entertain [him/her] in the car. Monitor [him/her] for signs of stress; if [he/she] is panting, drooling, or acting panicky, then you may need to backstep a bit and go back to just hanging out with the car on. This process can take some time, and it's important to really pay attention to [his/her] signs that [he/she] is overwhelmed. The idea is to keep [him/her] below [his/her] fear threshold in the car, and give [him/her] lots of tasty treats and love, so [he/she] stops associating cars with stress, and instead associates it with fun and snacks.

So, for any dog, a big part of resolving this issue is not correcting it after it happens, but preventing them from getting that reward in the first place as much as possible. That may involve changing your habits--not leaving food in reach on the counter, which can be hard to remember--and it may involve some creative prevention. Is there a way to block [his/her] access to where the food is entirely with baby gates or x-pens?

To start, I would recommend leaving a lightweight leash on [him/her] all the time for a while, and letting it drag on the ground, even while inside. We call that a \"drag leash.\" Next, pick out a word that you'll use for a verbal correction; we like 'eh-eh' or 'enough' because they're not words a dog hears often.

Give [him/her] a squirt of water across the rump, and use your verbal correction word. Your verbal command should be firm but neutral, as should the spray. The goal is not to scare the dog, but to pair the verbal correction and an unpleasant sensation (getting squirted with water), with the act of jumping on the counter. If that doesn't deter [him/her], this is when you will pick up [his/her] drag leash and walk [him/her] away from the counter. With repetition, [he/she] will learn that jumping up there results in an unpleasant experience (the squirt bottle and verbal correction).

All dogs have a \"threshold\" which is just the distance at which they can handle seeing other dogs without reacting. If you can find areas to walk [him/her] where you can keep a reasonable distance, that is an easy way to avoid [his/her] reactions. You can also bring high value treats on your walks, like cheese, chicken, or hotdogs. When you and [name] see other dogs, distract [him/her] with those treats and alter your course to avoid the dogs. Another way to use food to your advantage is to scoop a spoonful of peanut butter, then freeze the spoon. Bring that frozen peanut butter spoon on your walk with you (maybe just in a baggie in your pocket) and when you see dogs, let [name] lick the peanut butter while you walk past. \n",

			"text": "The behavior of pulling, barking, or growling on leash in response to other animals, people, etc is called \"on leash reactivity.\" This behavior is actually really common in dogs, and there are tried and true methods to work through it. To start, are you walking [him/her] just on [his/her] normal collar, or are you using any \"gear\" like a harness or Gentle Leader? Sometimes just getting some equipment can work wonders on dogs. We recommend either a Gentle Leader or a front clipping harness like an Easy Walk. If you want to talk in more detail about pros and cons of different equipment for walking, just let me know and we can talk through what is out there. \n\nWhile we can’t directly change how [name] feels in response to [his/her] triggers on leash, we can teach [him/her] a more appropriate response. We want to teach “replacement behaviors” that [name] will do instead of reacting. Typical replacement behaviors include having your dog sit calmly next to you and giving eye contact (aka “checking in”) when [he/she] sees the dog/person/etc that usually elicits [his/her] reactivity. We basically have to teach [him/her] impulse control - to think before [he/she] gives in to [his/her] desire to react. Don’t expect [name] to be able to perform these replacement behaviors right away, but with some time and effort on your part, [he/she] will learn that this new behavior is the preferable option. The first step you'll want to do is work on [him/her] being able to perform \"sit\" on verbal in a calm, quiet environment (like inside your home). Check out the videos I attached to this email on working on sitting with distractions and for duration. I’m going to attach another video that goes over teaching that eye contact is a rewardable behavior; this is really helpful because if [he/she] is looking at you for treats, [he/she] is not reacting at the people/dogs.  \n\nOnce [he/she] can do that consistently, we can start working through [his/her] behavior on leash. When you take [him/her] on walks, I suggest you start bringing treats along. Make sure they are high enough in value to [him/her] that she will be interested in them even with distractions around (this may mean the treats need to be cheese, chicken, or some other special thing [he/she] doesn't usually get). When you see a person or dog, hopefully before [he/she] sees said person or dog, first try to create some distance - move off to the side of the trail, cross the street, just add some buffer space. Next ask [him/her] to \"sit\" and then reward [him/her] with treats and praise for sitting. Continue to make [him/her] hold [his/her] sit (you can use the \"stay\" command if [he/she] knows it) while the distraction passes by. Any time [he/she] looks at you instead of the dog or person, heavily praise and reward [him/her] with treats. Once they are gone, release [him/her] from holding [his/her] sit and carry on your walk. \n\nThe key to this training technique is consistency and a foundation in the basics. If [he/she] can't hold a sit/stay at home without distractions, there is very little hope [he/she] will be able to hold it while out on walks in the exciting world. So depending on where [he/she] is at in [his/her] obedience training, you may need to start working on this just in your home, then progress to the outdoors.\n",

			"text": "Big Picture: I want to be able to ask my dog to sit and have [him/her] offer us eye contact while [his/her] trigger walks on by. Once the trigger has passed us we can move on.\n\nEquipment: I am curious to know what equipment you are currently walking your pup on? Are you using a flat collar, martingale collar, a front clipping harness, back clipping harness, or a Gentle Leader? When we are talking about different pieces of equipment we are mostly talking about where the dog is feeling pressure. You will see as we work through reactivity training that we use pressure a lot to communicate with dogs. We've come to learn that in moments of overarousal the words that come out of our mouths don't seem to register to dogs very well. In these moments we've learned that dogs do tend to be responsive to what they are feeling. \n\nWhen we are talking about highly reactive dogs or dogs who pull a lot, we most often suggest adopters/fosters use a gentle leader. Have you heard of a gentle leader before? A gentle leader is the equivalent of a bridle, which is used when walking or handling a horse - it loops around the dog’s nose. There are some misconceptions about a gentle leader. The biggest one being that a gentle leader is like a muzzle, which isn't true! When wearing a gentle leader a dog can eat, drink, play fetch, or even bite someone if they really wanted to. There are a couple of reasons we really like this tool. When wearing a gentle leader a dog is going to be feeling pressure up high behind their ears, and if they are really pulling or lunging then they will also feel a little pressure around their snout. This 'up high' pressure and pressure around their snout tends to be more meaningful and annoying for dogs to feel, which often results in them being more responsive to the pressure they are feeling. Not to mention that with a gentle leader a dog will often 'auto-correct' when they do lunge or have a negative reactive. This means that when a dog lunges or pulls really hard they will always feel the increased pressure, which signals to them that they’re making a mistake. \n\nWearing a gentle leader can be a little unnatural for dogs, so we often have to do some desensitization. HERE you will find a link with a really good video that teaches you how to desensitize your dog to this tool. We try to make positive associations with each step of putting the gentle leader on to help the pup start liking the gentle leader before actually wearing it or feeling pressure from it. \n\nIf you decide not to use a gentle leader (make sure you give it a try first!) and decide to use a harness, try to make sure that you are using a front clipping harness and not a back clipping harness. Dogs have an oppositional reflex, meaning that their center of gravity is located in the middle of their chest. When we use back clipping harnesses we are actually using that oppositional reflex against us. By clipping dogs in the back we are giving them the ability to use their chest muscles to pull forward, that's why you see sled dogs being clipped in the back. The theory behind a front clipping harness is to use that oppositional reflex in your favor and discourage your pup from pulling by having their equipment throw them a little off balance if they pull. \n\nIf you are simply using a collar, we suggest using a martingale collar vs. a flat collar. Martingale collars can tighten a little which will help ensure that your pup can't slip out of [his/her] collar if [he/she] is ever having an extremely reactive moment, but these collars don’t tighten enough to choke or harm a dog like some other equipment.  \n\nFundamental Skills:  When we are working reactivity we aren't really teaching dogs anything - we are using basic skills to change the emotional response that a dog is having to seeing a trigger (person, other dog, bike, car, etc.) There are two basic skills that we want to make sure we are mastering during reactivity work: sit and eye contact. \n\nEye Contact: Let's start off talking about eye contact. We consider eye-contact to be the most rewardable behavior. If we can get a dog to check in with us readily, then it gives us ample opportunity to give said dog direction and instructions. We often see a lot of mainstream trainers teach eye contact as a cue or command, meaning that they have a word, silly noise, or hand signal that is supposed to signal the dog to stop what they are doing and look up at their handler. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but it doesn't work for the training that we are doing. If your pup is hard staring, barking, lunging, etc. at another dog, you can't say 'look at me' and expect [him/her] to stop dead in [his/her] tracks and offer eye contact. At APA, we teach dogs to offer us eye contact on their own vs. us having to solicit it. This puts most of the responsibility on the dogs during stressful times and allows us to train them to look to us for positive reinforcement. \n\nWe want dogs to be able to look at a trigger and then decide to look up at us for guidance, giving us deference. There are two games that we play to start teaching dogs to offer us eye contact. The first exercise that we work through is a game that we call the 'made you look game':\n\nThe video above teaches you how we start working through this game. We want to make sure that we are starting to play this game indoors where the distractions are really low and your pup is really comfortable. Once you reach a point where you set your hands out in front of you to play this game and [name] stares straight into your soul, [he/she] gets it and you can start challenging them with more distracting scenarios. You want to make sure that you are adding the distractions really slowly. \n\nThe second game that we play, which is used to help generalize the idea that giving us eye contact makes good stuff happen, is called the capture game. Here's a video on how we play this game:\n\nFor this game you'll be storing treats up high in different rooms of your home. As you go through your day to day life, if you're making a sandwich, brushing your teeth, etc. and happen to notice that you and your pup make eye contact, you can quickly mark (say the cue “yes”) and then reward them with a treat. It doesn't matter if it takes you a second or two to get the treat to your pup. The 'yes' verbal marker will make the correlation on why the pup is being given a treat. \n\nSit: The second basic skill that we want to master is sit. [name] probably knows sit already in some capacity. When we are working on sit in the context of reactivity work, there are going to be a couple of extra rules that we are going to be instilling. First off, from here on out sit comes with an implied stay. This means that when you ask [name] to sit, the expectation is that [he/she] holds [his/her] booty on the ground until told otherwise. We also need to have a word or “cue” which releases [him/her] from the sit - at APA we use the word 'free'. Lastly, we are no longer going to be using treats to reward sitting; it's too easy. We're going to be reserving the treats for the really hard stuff, which is giving us eye contact/deference, especially around [his/her] triggers. (Feel free to use verbal praise when [name] listens to a sit cue. You can tell [him/her] [he/she]'s beautiful, wonderful, and amazing. Throw in a pet or two if you'd like, but remember we're saving the good stuff for the more valuable skill.) \n\nWe obviously need some sort of way to instill these new rules. We use “pressure and release” - have you ever heard of this concept? \n\nPressure and release spelled out: We are going to be asking [name] to sit once verbally. The reason we only ask [him/her] to sit one time is because we need [him/her] to know that we mean business the first time around. We are going to be using these skills in compromising situations where [name] is around dogs or people whom [he/she] typically reacts towards, we don't have time to repeat ourselves or wrestle with the [him/her] to make [him/her] sit. \n\nIf your pup sits then pops right back up, or completely ignores you, you will (very slowly and very gradually) start adding leash pressure straight up to the sky with your leash. This isn't meant to hurt or lift [name] off the ground - it's meant to be a little annoying as [he/she] is feeling this pressure, maybe a little uncomfortable as well. As soon as [he/she] sits down and puts [his/her] booty on the floor, all of the pressure goes away. We do this to communicate to [him/her] that if [he/she] feels any pressure [he/she] is doing something wrong, and if [he/she] doesn’t feel pressure then [he/she] is doing the right thing. \n\nThe two videos above teach you how to work through pressure and release exercises to start enforcing sit with its new rules. When you are starting to teach this, if you reach a point where you are about to lift the dog off the ground, stop adding pressure. Instead, hold the pressure at 'maximum pressure' and start adding a little downward pressure to the pups butt as a secondary signal of what we want from them. As soon as [his/her] butt hits the floor we again release all of the pressure. \n\nMultitasking: Lastly, I want to quickly chat about starting to put these two skills together. (Make sure that you are mastering them individually at first, it'll make your life SO much easier.) Work through the sit exercises, making sure that you are not repeating yourself if/when your dog pops up out of [his/her] sit and instead only using pressure and release to cue [him/her] back to sitting. If your dog offers you eye contact while [he/she] is seated, you should use that 'y-e-s' work to mark this good behavior, and make sure that they are treated/rewarded right afterwards. \n\nYou want to make sure that you are practicing all of this inside of your home at first, where the distractions are low and your pup is really comfortable. Once [he/she] masters these skills indoors without any distractions, increase the difficulty level really slowly. For example: start off practicing multitasking inside your home without any distractions. Once [he/she] masters this, do the same thing but with the blinds open, or with the TV on, or with a friend moving about the kitchen - and so on and so forth! \n\nWe spend a lot of time in reactivity class teaching the humans involved and helping them become better handlers - half the battle here is empowering you to understand how to handle [name]. Obviously, with all of the COVID-19 stuff going on we aren't able to meet in person and help you really become comfortable with working through all of these skills. We are trying our best to continue to support people, their pups, and their behavior needs through these unusual times. I super encourage you to film yourself working the multitasking that we talked about. Send that video over to me and I will be more than happy to give you pointers on things we can try differently to ensure further success. Please don't be shy! I'm here to help! \n\nLastly (promise this is the last one) I want you to keep in mind that your pup still isn't “fixed” and you are still in the land of avoidance and management. This means that you should be walking away and trying to avoid other dogs or triggers as often as possible. We want to intentionally start teaching our pups what we want them to do and make sure those skills are super solid before we start saying 'no don't do that'. Think of it in human terms, if you started a new job where you had no training but people started to get upset with you when you messed up-- you'd probably be pretty over it and quit fairly soon too!

			"text": "A regression in potty training can happen in adult dogs for a variety of reasons. The first thing you want to rule out is any medical issues that she may be having, causing her to go to the bathroom in the house. If that is not the case then there are some different things you can try depending on what the root cause seems to be. First, I would be sure to clean all areas of your home that Butter's has gone to the bathroom in with an enzyme cleaner. Dogs are scent oriented so even if people can't smell things, dogs still can and it can encourage them to mark or potty in that spot again, and the enzyme cleaner helps remove those smells. \n\nNext, make sure you praise and reward her (with treats she really likes) every time she goes potty outdoors, and take her out frequently. For the time being, attach a lightweight leash to her collar that is always on her, dragging on the ground, so that when you need to walk her outside you can just pick up the leash and go. If you catch her pottying indoors, interrupt her with a loud clap of your hands and then lead her outside. By consistently interrupting her inside and praising and rewarding her for going outside you will teach her what is appropriate and inappropriate for going potty. Remember to always be consistent in your training. If you cannot keep an eye on her while home, then put her in her crate so that she doesn't get a chance to go potty when you are not there to guide her outside.

			"text": "I’m sorry to hear [name] is struggling with separation anxiety. This behavior is not all that uncommon, especially dogs that are adjusting to big life changes like settling in to a new home. Dogs like routines; [name]’s life recently has not had all that much consistency, and that could be contributing to some of [his/her] anxiety. Sometimes we see this kind of anxiety reduce on its own once the dog has some \"decompression\" time in the home. Other times, dogs need a little help to realize that being alone isn’t all that scary. I am going to attach a resource that walks through some techniques to help curb separation anxiety. It will take some time, consistency, and patience on your part to get [him/her] to a point where [he/she] can be left alone without anxiety, but it is possible.",

			"text": "I am going to provide you a few resources to look through to start working on this behavior with [name]. One is our general guideline on working through separation anxiety, another is a document on crate training, and the last is a document on \"Canine Enrichment,\" aka ways to occupy your dog while you are home. Read through all these and let me know if you have any questions on the content. These documents will go into more detail than I will in this email, but I will quickly touch on some points that may help. In terms of separation anxiety, there are a few things you can try right away to ease your pup's mind a bit. Playing white noise while you're gone can be helpful for dogs who get anxious hearing outside noises. Other dogs find comfort in cuddling with a shirt or other item of clothing that smells like you. Some dogs just need something to distract them, like a long-lasting treat such as a Kong stuffed with treats/kibble/peanut butter. The \"Canine Enrichment\" document will provide you with some creative solutions to distract dogs with food. We also encourage you to crate train your dog. \"Crate training\" is more than just buying a crate and crating your dog while you're away; this is teaching your dog that their crate is their safe place, their place they can feed safe and happy. If introduced correctly, crating can be a safe way to ensure [name] is not being destructive while you are away, and even provide some comfort to [him/her]. Some dogs really take to the crate and like to snooze in there in their free time because it is their \"room.\" Check out the crate training document for more details on how to make the crate a positive place for your pup. We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. If possible, arrange your departures to be right as you put down [his/her] food, so [he/she] can focus on food instead of being stressed about your departure. Also, try to make your arrivals as low-key as possible. Ignore [name] for the first few minutes you get home. We want to teach [him/her] it is not exciting that you arrive home. Once [he/she] settles a bit, then you can calmly acknowledge [him/her]. Slowly breaking down the excitement/anxiety of your departures and arrivals is crucial to diminishing separation anxiety.",

Adult dogs can go a couple days without food with no long-term negative effects, so try not to stress too much. Keep offering [him/her] food at [his/her] meal times. If you're worried and want [him/her] to start eating sooner, you can mix something especially yummy, like plain yogurt, canned dog food or low-sodium, onion free broth, in with [his/her] kibble to entice [him/her] to eat. As [he/she] starts to feel more comfortable in your home [his/her] appetite should return. If [his/her] appetite doesn't return in the next few days, please let me know.",

			"text": "It is not unusual for a dog to be more anxious in the beginning as they are decompressing from the shelter and acclimating to their new environment and human. Pacing, panting, and the inability to settle down are all typical signs of anxiety in dogs. Dogs like routines; they are creatures of habit. Right now, [name]’s routines have been all shaken up, so [he/she] may be feeling a bit uncertain. It will take some patience and love on your part while [name] realizes that [he/she] has made it to [his/her] forever home.\n\nIn the meantime, know that this anxious behavior is normal. It can be stressful for you, as the human, to watch [him/her] not be able to relax, but try not to let it bother you too much. There are a few things you can do to help [name] acclimate faster. First, try to establish a routine for [name]. Wake up, feed, and walk [him/her] around the same times, so [he/she] can expect what is going to happen in [his/her] life. Next, try to avoid causing extra stress through activities that we may think are fun or necessary, but to dogs are just overwhelming. This could be taking a trip to the pet store, getting a bath, or meeting a lot of new people. Try to keep things calm and predictable at first, and as [he/she] settles in, start introducing [him/her] to more exciting things. Overall, the key here is just giving [name] time to decompress, and to respect [his/her] space and feelings as [he/she] adjusts to this huge change in [his/her] life. \n",
