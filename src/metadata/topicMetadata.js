I’ll briefly talk through the general points presented in the document, but for more detail, check it out. Basically, the first week we don’t want to try to introduce them at all. Transitions are stressful for dogs, so giving [name] a little time to settle in and adjust to [his/her] new environment before introducing them would allow [him/her] to be a little calmer, which can be helpful. During this time, you could also start working on some basic obedience (specifically \"sit\") which will be helpful in this process. Once [name] has settled in, you can do the first real stage of the introductions. You’ll have your dog on leash, and have the cat in the room, preferably contained in a large dog crate or something along those lines, so they can’t get too close to the dog if they want to. While they’re \"interacting\" like this (in the same room, but not close to each other or actually touching), work on rewarding [name] for ignoring the cat and paying attention to you. We basically want to desensitize [him/her] to their presence, so the cat isn’t exciting or something to be worked up about. Continue these exercises of them just existing in the same space, slowly decreasing the space between the two, and look for [name] consistently ignoring or showing calm behavior around the cat. After a week or two of this, move to the next stage, which is letting the cats roam free while [name] is still on leash. Continue to look for appropriate behaviors, and work on letting them get closer. Eventually you’ll transition to letting go of the leash. Keep the leash on [name], but let it drag on the ground. If [he/she] tries to chase the cat, you can step on the leash and halt [him/her] from running. Always supervise them together, and make sure that the cat has lots of \"escape routes\" that the dog cannot follow - baby gates between rooms, cat trees, counters etc. If the cat tries to communicate to [name] to back off (hissing, swatting, etc), make sure [he/she] listens to the cat. If [he/she] continues to try to play/pester the cat when the cat is telling [him/her] to back off, you should step in and back your cat up. Again, check out the document for more detail, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions or want to talk through this in more detail. ",

		"text": "Thanks for reaching out about the issues you're experiencing with [name]'s chewing behaviors. This behavior is pretty common in dogs, which luckily means that there are plenty of techniques you can use to curb it! To start, it’s important to set [name] up for success as best you can. This means removing items from [his/her] reach that [he/she] might try to chew. If [he/she] only has good choices to choose from, [he/she] will get in the habit of picking the right objects. Along with that, you should make sure [he/she] has plenty of other appropriate things to chew on, like toys and bones, so [he/she] can get that chewing urge out in a healthy way. When [he/she] chooses to chew on those, praise [him/her], play with [him/her], do whatever makes [him/her] happy. This will teach [him/her] that chewing on appropriate things results in praise and fun. Another helpful thing will be to teach \"drop\" or \"leave it,\" so when [he/she] gets something that is inappropriate, you can ask for it back without it turning into a game of chase or tug of war. Also, make sure only to correct [him/her] (using verbal corrections like \"no\" or \"eh eh\") while [he/she]’s in the act of chewing something, not afterwards. Getting the timing of the correction down is important, so [he/she] understands that what [he/she]  is doing in that moment is not appropriate. Dogs won’t understand why they are getting scolded if you don’t catch them in the act. They may still act sheepish, but they really don’t connect the dots that the punishment is due to something that happened earlier in the day, so the behavior won't change. For more tips and details, I'm attaching our go-to document on chewing, which has some additional techniques to try to curb this behavior. Depending on how destructive [his/her] chewing is (i.e. ruining entire couches or just lightly munching a shoe) some of the tips may be overkill. Nonetheless, it’s a good resource to start with. Look through that document and let me know if you have any questions.",

Is [he/she] showing anxiety when you leave [him/her] alone, or is it just centered around being in the crate? Have you tried any strategies to get [him/her] more comfortable in the crate? I have a couple resources for you to look at that will help us get [him/her] more comfortable in the crate, being alone in general, and help prevent [him/her] from busting of the crate in the first place. Check out these documents and see if there are any techniques in there that you can use. A tip that can be really helpful is to try to occupy [his/her] attention with something positive while [he/she] is in the crate. If you're not already, feed [him/her] in his crate, and make feeding a bit more of a game for [him/her]. Check out the \"Canine Enrichment\" document I'm attaching for some easy ways to make [him/her] work a little harder on [his/her] food while [he/she] is in the crate. This is beneficial because it channels [his/her] focus into doing something healthy and productive, as opposed to focusing on the fact that [he/she] is stuck in the crate. Also, I would recommend securing the joints of the crate with zip ties. Sometimes dogs bend the metal of the crate enough to be able to escape; using zip ties will make this very difficult to do. If the crate is not showing signs of bending like that, [he/she] may have just figured out how to undo the latch from the inside (if so [he/she] is a smart cookie!). Check out the tutorial on how to \"spy\" on [him/her] via Skype. If you can set that up, you can monitor [him/her] from another room or out of the house and see what [he/she] gets up to. Once we have a clear idea of how [he/she] is breaking out, we can work on ways to prevent it better.",

			"text": "The behavior of pulling, barking, or growling on leash in response to other animals, people, etc is called \"on leash reactivity.\" This behavior is actually really common in dogs, and there are tried and true methods to work through it. While we can’t directly change how [name] feels in response to [his/her] triggers on leash, we can teach [him/her] a more appropriate response. We want to teach “replacement behaviors” that [name] will do instead of reacting. Typical replacement behaviors include having your dog sit calmly next to you and giving eye contact (aka “checking in”) when they see the dog/person/etc that usually elicits their reactivity. Don’t expect [name] to be able to perform these replacement behaviors right away, but with some time and effort on your part, [he/she] will learn that this new behavior is the preferable option. The first step you'll want to do is work on her being able to perform \"sit\" on verbal in a calm, quiet environment (like inside your home). Check out the videos I attached to this emails on working on sitting with distractions and for duration. Once [he/she] can do that consistently, we can start working through [his/her] behavior on leash. When you take [him/her] on walks, I suggest you start bringing treats along. Make sure they are high enough in value to [him/her] that she will be interested in them even with distractions around (this may mean the treats need to be cheese, chicken, or some other special thing [he/she] doesn't usually get). When you see a person or dog, hopefully before [he/she] sees said person or dog, first try to create some distance - move off to the side of the trail, cross the street, just add some buffer space. Next ask [him/her] to \"sit\" and then reward [him/her] with treats and praise for sitting. Continue to make [him/her] hold [his/her] sit (you can use the \"stay\" command if [he/she] knows it) while the distraction passes by. Any time [he/she] looks at you instead of the dog or person, heavily praise and reward [him/her] with treats. Once they are gone, release [him/her] from holding [his/her] sit and carry on your walk. I’m going to attach another video that goes over teaching that eye contact is a rewardable behavior; this is really helpful because if [he/she] is looking at you for treats, [he/she] is not reacting at the people/dogs. The key to this training technique is consistency and a foundation in the basics. If [he/she] can't hold a sit/stay at home without distractions, there is very little hope [he/she] will be able to hold it while out on walks in the exciting world. So depending on where [he/she] is at in her obedience training, you may need to start working on this just in your home, then progress to the outdoors.",

			"text": "I’m sorry that [name] is pulling a lot on leash. That can definitely make walks stressful and not fun for the human at the other end of the leash. Luckily, there are lots of training techniques that can help teach [name] how to be a little more polite on leash. To start, are you walking [him/her] just on [his/her] normal collar, or are you using any “gear” like a harness or Gentle Leader? Sometimes just getting some equipment can work wonders on dogs. We recommend either a Gentle Leader or a front clipping harness like an Easy Walk. If you want to talk in more detail about pros and cons of different equipment for walking, just let me know and we can talk through what is out there. Next, when you’re walking, we recommend bringing along some high value treats, like cheese, chicken, or hot dogs. You’re going to have to be communicating with your dog what is and is not “good” behavior on leash; having treats on hand will allow you to reinforce the good behavior and teach [name] what you want faster. The technique we use at APA to teach dogs not to pull uses “Drop and Go’s.” I’m going to attach a couple videos to this document that walks through how to implement “Drop and Go’s” and polite leash skills in general. Please watch those, and then get back to me. If you have any questions on what they videos cover, I can break it down in more detail for you.",

Typically if an adult dog suddenly regresses in potty training, the first thing we want to rule out is an underlying medical issue. I would recommend talking to your vet about this and see what they think. In case it is not a medical issue, I will attach our document on House Training for adult dogs. Have you had any big changes in your life lately, like moving to a new home, getting/losing roommates, or changing your work hours? Dogs can handle stress of transitions in different ways, so if there is some large change in [his/her] life, this behavior could be a result of that. Is [he/she] having accidents when you are home, or is it only when you are away? If it is only when you’re away, this could be a sign of separation anxiety.

By consistently interrupting [him/her] inside and praising [him/her] for going outside you will teach [him/her] what is appropriate and inappropriate for going potty. Remember to always be consistent in your training. If you cannot keep an eye on [him/her] while home, then put [him/her] in [his/her] crate so that [he/she] doesn't get a chance to go potty when you are not there to guide [him/her] outside.

			"text": "Potty training puppies takes time, consistency, and above all, patience. It is a process that all owners of young pups have to go through, and it can certainly be frustrating at times! Usually it takes puppies till they're around 6 months or older before they really consistently get potty training down. If [he/she] is occasionally having accidents in the house, but generally starting to understand that [he/she] should go outside, then you are on the right track. I’m attaching our “Puppy Basics” document, which has a section dedicated specifically to helping work through potty training. Look through that and let me know if you have any questions on how to implement those techniques. The most important takeaways from that document are to set a schedule/routine and take [him/her] out often. Dogs thrive on routines, so getting [him/her] to a point where [he/she] expects to be let out will go a long way to motivate [him/her] to hold [his/her] business. Make sure you praise [him/her] when [he/she] goes outside, and don’t punish [him/her] if [he/she] does potty indoors. If you scold [him/her] for going indoors, [he/she] could start being scared to go potty in front of you at all, even outdoors, which is definitely not what we want. Instead, if/when [he/she] does have an accident indoors, try to catch [him/her] in the act and take [him/her] outside immediately, where you reward [him/her] for finishing up [his/her] business. This way, [he/she] learns that pottying indoors gets interrupted, but pottying outdoors gets rewarded! I want to note that even if you’re doing everything right, it can take a while for puppies to fully understand and master potty training, so don’t worry if [he/she] has slip ups sometimes. Just continue to follow the guidelines, reward good choices, and interrupt [him/her] when [he/she] potties indoors.",

We as their humans have to teach them that what is appropriate communication with dogs is not always appropriate with humans -- mainly that they can't chomp on us when they are playing. I am going to attach a document to this email that is called “Puppy Basics.” It specifically has a section that walks through how to curb this behavior. There are a couple main takeaways that I’ll quickly walk through here, but I encourage you to read through the document, as it goes into this in a bit more depth. To start, you always want to have items that are appropriate for [name] to chew on close by. That way, when [he/she] goes to grab on to you when you’re playing, you can offer [him/her] a toy instead. If [he/she] engages with the toy, be sure to reward that behavior by praising [him/her] and continuing to play with [him/her]. If [he/she] will not be distracted by a toy, then you should ignore [him/her] when [he/she] starts to get mouthy. Don’t scold, just stand up, look away, and become a statue. Pretend [he/she] doesn’t exist. This way, [he/she] learns that grabbing a toy results in continued play (good), but grabbing you results in the end of play and all attention (bad).",

We want to teach them that jumping is not an appropriate way to show their enthusiasm, and will not get them what they want. There are a few things you can do to work on curbing this behavior. You can teach [name] an incompatible behavior, like “sit,” so when [he/she] goes to jump on you, you ask [him/her] for a sit instead. This in turn rewards [him/her] for [his/her] good behavior when [he/she] sits, and breaks the habit of jumping up when excited. Another technique you can try is just completely ignoring [him/her] when [he/she] jumps. If [he/she] is jumping for attention, and then gets the exact opposite of that every time [he/she] jumps, [he/she] will soon learn jumping is not a good way to get what [he/she] wants. Along this train of thought, be sure to reward [him/her] for polite behavior. Teach [name] that calm behavior results in attention, praise, and pets, while jumpy behavior results in the absence of all of those.

Read through all these and let me know if you have any questions on the content. These documents will go into more detail than I will in this email, but I will quickly touch on some points that may help. In terms of separation anxiety, there are a few things you can try right away to ease your pup's mind a bit. Playing white noise while you're gone can be helpful for dogs who get anxious hearing outside noises. Other dogs find comfort in cuddling with a shirt or other item of clothing that smells like you. Some dogs just need something to distract them, like a long-lasting treat such as a Kong stuffed with treats/kibble/peanut butter. The \"Canine Enrichment\" document will provide you with some creative solutions to distract dogs with food. We also encourage you to crate train your dog. \"Crate training\" is more than just buying a crate and crating your dog while you're away; this is teaching your dog that their crate is their safe place, their place they can feed safe and happy. If introduced correctly, crating can be a safe way to ensure [name] is not being destructive while you are away, and even provide some comfort to [him/her]. Some dogs really take to the crate and like to snooze in there in their free time because it is their \"room.\" Check out the crate training document for more details on how to make the crate a positive place for your pup. We recommend feeding [name] in [his/her] crate, so [he/she] associates the crate with food. If possible, arrange your departures to be right as you put down [his/her] food, so [he/she] can focus on food instead of being stressed about your departure. Also, try to make your arrivals as low-key as possible. Ignore [name] for the first few minutes you get home. We want to teach [him/her] it is not exciting that you arrive home. Once [he/she] settles a bit, then you can calmly acknowledge [him/her]. Slowly breaking down the excitement/anxiety of your departures and arrivals is crucial to diminishing separation anxiety.",
