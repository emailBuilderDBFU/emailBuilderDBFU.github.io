4. Use React.js to create UI 
    - Do some reasearch / learn it (Codecademy?)
    - Implement it (you may need to re-work your model a bit)
    - Feel free to stop at a "static" page here. 
    - Hardcode what requirements will be shown
    - Hardcode what text will be shown (try to pull it from the hardcoded topics still)
5. Add email templates as text files
    - Make them available as static resources (with Flask)
    - Update client-side to pull text from these files, not hardcoded text
    - Still hardcode what topics are "selected" and what requirement values are used
6. Update UI to be fully responsive
    - Make everything more dynamic
    - Fill in requirements as topics are selected
    - Update final text with valus from requirements
    - This should be your "finished" product
7. Come up with a list of V2 improvements
    - User login
    - Persisted data
